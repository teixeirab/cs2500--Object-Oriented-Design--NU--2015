   * CLASS INVARIANTS:
   *
   *  - buffer.length == capacity
   *  - refBits.length == capacity
   *  - hand < capacity
   *  - size <= capacity
   *  - items in buffer are unique
   *
   * REPRESENTATION NOTE:
   *
   * The main idea here is that the two arrays are circular buffers,
   * in the sense that the starting index {@code hand} can be anywhere in
   * the buffer, and the logical queue wraps around from the end to the
   * beginning.
   *
   * Thus, the nth element of the queue can be found at (hand + n) % capacity.
   *
   * Example: the array { 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2 } with hand = 5 and size = 4
   * stands for the logical queue 1, 2, 3, 4. This is because the head of
   * the queue starts at the 5th (0-based) element of the array and then
   * wraps around to include 4 items.
   *
   * (Note that the above example will not happen with this class,
   * because the array fills from left to right, and once full stays full.
   * Thus, it will always be the case that if hand != 0 then size ==
   * capacity. Nowhere do we rely on this invariant.
