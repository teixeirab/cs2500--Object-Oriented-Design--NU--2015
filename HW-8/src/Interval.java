/**
 * Generic intervals over comparable types.
 * <p>
 * In interval represents a continuous (or more formally, convex) set of values
 * between two endpoints. Either endpoint may be included in the interval, in
 * which case we say that the endpoint is closed, or excluded, in which case
 * the endpoint is open. For example (assuming we are working with {@code
 * Double}s):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The interval (0, 1) represents all the numbers between 0 and 1, with
 *   both 0 and 1 excluded.
 *   <li>The interval [0, 1) represents all the numbers between 0 and 1, with 0
 *   included and 1 excluded.
 *   <li>The interval (0, 1] represents all the numbers between 0 and 1, with 0
 *   excluded and 1 included.
 *   <li>The interval [0, 1] represents all the numbers between 0 and 1, with
 *   both 0 and 1 included.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Additionally, a closed interval where both endpoints are the same
 * represents the singleton set of that one number. That is, [3, 3]
 * represents the set containing only 3. A half-open-half-closed interval
 * where both endpoints are the same, such as [5, 5) or (9, 9] represents the
 * empty set. Because the bound in such cases is arbitrary, all intervals
 * representing the empty set are equal. Intervals where the lower bound is
 * greater than the upper bound are undefined, and implementations of this
 * interface must avoid constructing them.
 * <p>
 * Note that the notions of less-than and greater for type {@code T} used to
 * define the interval are determined by a comparator, which can be retrieved
 * using {@link #getComparator()}. Even for numeric types, it may be the case
 * that that the order is not the natural order. Operations that involve
 * multiple intervals ({@link #includes(Interval) #includes(Interval&lt;T&gt;)},
 * {@link #intersection(Interval) #intersection(Interval&lt;T&gt;)}, and
 * {@link #span(Interval) #span(Interval&lt;T&gt;)}) require that
 * both intervals involved use the same comparator (or at least comparators
 * that are observably equivalent); if the comparators disagree then the
 * behavior of the operations is undefined and may be incoherent.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the interval endpoints

   * is included in both, all the points between 3 and 5 are included in

   * <em>and</em> the gap.
   * <p>
   * For example, the span of (1, 2) and [4, 10] is (1, 10], since the
   * smaller lower bound of the two intervals is 1 (exclusive), and the
   * larger upper bound of the two intervals is 10 (inclusive). Both (1, 2)
   * and [4, 10] are included in (1, 10], but if we moved either bound inward
   * then at least one of them would not be included.

   * that are between the lower and upper bounds according to the comparator.
   * Equality as needed for closed bounds is defined by where the comparator
   * returns 0, not where the {@link Object#equals(Object)} method for type
